# Overview

Simple software to learn how to make calls to a firebase database. I wanted to learn how to call, modify, and delete enteries in a database from an outside software. Understanding the basics of how a database works will help me learn what information I need to protect and how it is sctructed for future projects.

I made a simple javaScript program that will display the information that is called from the database and then you can edit it and update that information inside of the database. If you choose to no longer want a data entery in the database you can also remove or delete that entery. 

I like to go on different hikes but sometimes my memory fails me in remember the names or other parts about the hikes I may want to know in the future. This project allowed me to enter some of the different hikes I have done into a database that I can go back and look at in the future.

# Cloud Database

I am using the firebase cloud database. 

I have large collection of the different trails that I have hiked. Each trail in the collection is stored under the name of the trail when it is entered in. Each trial can show the name, lenght, and a general difficulty of the trail for future refrence. 

# Development Environment

I used firebase and its documentation to learn how to be able to do each of the functions I wanted to use. I used youtube and stackoverflow to find solutions to questions I had that I got along the way. 

I used JavaScript, and html to create a simple webpage that has inputs and buttons that will preform each of the functions I wanted for my project.

# Future Work

* Make it so it will display all the data with certain enteries such as the same difficulty or length.
* A better UI that is more appealing.
* More trails inside of the Database.
* A website that could use the database to display the information in a useful way.
